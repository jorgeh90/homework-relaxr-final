Relaxr Landing Page: Part 1
==================

We'll be working on this site for the next three classes, just a heads up.

For today, we'll begin making a simplified version of the site which uses only one column. 

Your job is to:

1) Create the markup for the mockup design
2) Build out the CSS - using the information below, style your markup using CSS.  You may need to use resources in the Class repo, Google questions you have etc.
